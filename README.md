# My Project

## Overview
This project is a web application that uses **Express** as the backend framework, **MongoDB** as the database, **Multer** for handling file uploads, **Google OAuth2.0** for user authentication, and supports mobile-responsive design. The app is built with the following key features:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login via Google OAuth2.0 for user authentication.
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware handles image and file uploads.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-responsive frontend.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user and file data securely.

## Features
- **Google OAuth2.0 Login**: Users can sign in using their Google account for authentication.
- **User Authorization**: Restrict access to certain routes based on user roles (admin, user, etc.).
- **Multer Integration**: Secure file upload handling with file validation (e.g., image formats, file size limits).
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile screens using CSS media queries and frameworks like Bootstrap or custom responsive styles.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user information, files, and other app-related data.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to build the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store application data.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads.
- **Google OAuth2.0**: Used for user authentication and login.
- **CSS/HTML**: Frontend for user interface, with a focus on responsiveness.
- **Bootstrap** (or any similar framework): For fast and easy responsive layout.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (either locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- [Google OAuth credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (for integrating Google login)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   cd your-project



GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret



Authentication
POST /auth/google: Redirects to Google OAuth2.0 login.
GET /auth/google/callback: Handles the callback from Google after successful authentication.
GET /logout: Logs the user out of the application.
File Uploads
POST /upload: Uploads files (e.g., images). Multer handles the file processing.

Request Body (Form-data):

file: The file to be uploaded (must be an image or supported file type).
Response:

Returns the URL or path to the uploaded file.
User Routes (Authenticated)
GET /profile: Fetches the authenticated user's profile.
GET /dashboard: Access to the user dashboard (restricted to logged-in users).
Google OAuth2.0 Integration
Google OAuth2.0 is used for user authentication. When a user logs in using their Google account, the backend verifies the identity and creates a session.

The passport-google-oauth20 strategy is used to handle OAuth authentication.

In the backend, you'll find this implementation in the auth.js controller and passport strategy setup.

Multer Integration
Multer handles file uploads in the application. We use it in the route /upload to handle file uploads securely.

Only specific file types (e.g., images) are allowed.
File size limits are enforced to prevent large files from being uploaded.

const multer = require('multer');
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
  }
});

const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({ storage: storage, fileFilter: fileFilter, limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } });


Mobile Responsiveness
This app is designed to be mobile-friendly using:

CSS Media Queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
Responsive Grid System (using frameworks like Bootstrap or custom CSS) to ensure the app looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
